<h1><a id="what" class="anchor" href="#what" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What?</h1>

<p><strong>Our pilot event was a 2-day workshop teaching refugees from the Cologne area web development (with the framework Ruby on Rails) using laptops donated by the community. We are planning to turn it into a regular event.</strong></p>

<p>For the <strong>refugees</strong> this is on the one hand an opportunity to use the time that they have to learn a new skill and on the other hand a chance to get introduced to the local tech community.</p>

<p>For the organizers, coaches and the local tech community it is a way to help refugees by doing what we like and what we are good at. It enables close contact with our new fellow citizen. And it might help to bring new talent to our industry.</p>

<h1><a id="team" class="anchor" href="#team" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who are we?</h1>

<p>We are a group of volunteers from the Cologne tech community who would like to use their skill to help refugees here in Cologne</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jakob Hilden</li>
  <li>Denise Schynol</li>
  <li>Christian Vervoorts</li>
  <li>Tatjana Lajendäcker</li>
  <li>and more</li>
</ul>


<h1><a id="help" class="anchor" href="#help" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How can I help?</h1>

<p>There are many ways to help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Help us reach the right participants in the refugee community</li>
  <li>You (or your company) could donate some not too old laptops</li>
  <li>We are looking for coaches/mentors for our workshop(s)</li>
  <li>There are many other areas that need organizing help (editing, design, PR, logistics, anything)</li>
  <li>Come to our <a href="#weekly-meetings">weekly orga-meeting</a></li>
</ul>

<h1><a id="laptop-donations" class="anchor" href="#laptop-donations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Laptop Donations</h1>

<p>Do you or your company have any old laptops that are not really used for anything anymore?  You can give your laptops a new life and make a real change for on of our refugee participants.</p>

<p><strong></strong>We currently are still in need of 10 more laptops in order to provide for all the participants.</strong></p>

<p>Here are the infos on how the donation works:
  <ul>
    <li>We will securely wipe all the data on your laptop(s) for you using military-grade software, so you don't have to worry about that.</li>
    <li>Laptops can be dropped of during business hours at the even location (address see above)</li>
    <li>For the laptops to be useful for programming they need to meet the basic requirements of at least a 2 core CPU and 2 GB of RAM.</li>
    <li>The laptops remain property of Refugeesonrails, but can be taken home by the participants.</li>
  </ul>
</p>


<h1><a id="weekly-meetings" class="anchor" href="#weekly-meetings" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Weekly Orga-Meetings</h1>

<h1><a id="future" class="anchor" href="#future" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What are the plans for the future?</h1>

<p>We first want to organize this first pilot workshop. After that we will know more about how we can best help the refugees. If you have other ideas what you and the Cologne tech community could do for refugees, please let us know. Our initiative is very open to new directions in the future.</p>
