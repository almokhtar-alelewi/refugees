# About

**We are a group of volunteers from the Cologne tech community that provide free mentorship
to refugees who are interested in learning coding.**

We started in late 2015 and first orgnized some individual weekend workshops. We since moved to a **regular** rhythm of having **mentorship meetings** with the coaches and students **every 2nd Thursday** evening.

For the **refugees/students** our meetings are an opportunity to use the "downtime" that they currently have (because they are not permitted to work yet) to learn a new skill that will be helpful for them in the future.
In addition it's a also a lot about networking and cultural exchange, it's a good way to get to know new people form the local tech community.

For us the **coaches, organizers and the local tech community** it is a way to help refugees by doing what we like and what we are good at. It enables close contact with our new fellow citizen. And it might help to bring new talent to our industry.

In addition to the mentorship we are also providing **donated laptops**, which we source from local companies and  individuals, to the refugees so that they can continue learning to code at home.

# When?

We meet every other week on Thursday nights at 19:00.  The next upcoming dates are:

# Who is this for?

Our mentorship meetings are meant for all interested refugees from the Cologne region.

You should have decent English/German skills and a strong interest in computers. Programming experience is very helpful and welcome, but not required.  Everything else (laptops,
location, drinks, etc.) will be provided by us.

If you want to come to our meetings, it would be nice if you put your name into our [scheduling Doodle](http://doodle.com/poll/vspxtbxfvfxwpdtg), but it is not required.

# Learning content

For the meetings, we don't have any particular lessons or a curriculum prepared for the students.  Instead we just have a number of coaches with a wide variety of skills that are happy to provide mentorship in any way that works or to help with little projects that students are working on.

If you don't already know what you want to learn/get mentorship for, we offer 2 tracks of tutorials that you can do (together with our help):

## Track 1: HTML for beginners

*   Understand how web pages work
*   Build your first web page (for example a personal portfolio page)
*   Apply custom styling with CSS
*   Create interactive websites with JavaScript
*   You do not need any previous programming experience for this
*   This is the tutorial that we will use: [http://code.makery.ch/library/html-css/](http://code.makery.ch/library/html-css/)

## Track 2: Advanced web development (with Ruby on Rails)

*   For everybody that already knows a little bit of HTML/Css
*   RailsGirls App Tutorial: [http://guides.railsgirls.com/app](http://guides.railsgirls.com/app)
*   Having some basic programming experience is certainly helpful, but not required

# Coaches

Volunteer coaches from the communtiy

If you would consider coaching at at our meetings, just join our [Slack chat channel](https://colognerb.herokuapp.com/) and come to one of our orga-meetings

# Who are we?

We are a group of volunteers from the Cologne tech community who would like to
use their skill to help refugees here in Cologne

*   Jakob Hilden
*   Denise Schynol
*   Christian Vervoorts
*   Tatjana Lajendäcker
*   Tim Fischbach
*   and more

# How can I help?

There are many ways to help:

*   Help us reach the right participants in the refugee community
*   You (or your company) could donate some not too old laptops
*   We are looking for coaches/mentors for our workshop(s)
*   There are many other areas that need organizing help (editing, design, PR, logistics, anything)

# Laptop Donations

Do you or your company have any old laptops that are not really used for
anything anymore? You can give your laptops a new life and make a real change
for on of our refugee participants.

Here is how the donation works:

*   We will securely wipe all the data on your laptop(s) for you using military-grade software, so you don't have to worry about that.
*   Laptops can be dropped of during business hours at Railslove (address see above)
*   For the laptops to be useful for programming they need to meet the basic requirements of at least a 2 core CPU and 2 GB of RAM.
*   The laptops remain property of Refugeesonrails, but can be taken home by the participants.

# What are the plans for the future?

We are still a very young initiative and are very open to new people and new ideas.  So, if you have other ideas what you and the Cologne tech community could do for refugees, please let us know. We are very open for new directions.
